Technologies Used: Python, Tkinter, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Project Description:
Developed a classic Hangman game application using Python and the Tkinter library, leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create a structured and interactive user experience.

Key Features:

Graphical User Interface (GUI): Designed an intuitive and visually appealing GUI with Tkinter, including buttons, labels, and canvas for the hangman graphics.
Word Database: Incorporated a diverse set of words for the game, stored and managed efficiently.
Gameplay Mechanics: Implemented the core gameplay logic, including letter guessing, word completion, and tracking incorrect guesses.
Dynamic Feedback: Provided real-time feedback to the player with visual cues for correct and incorrect guesses, and updated the hangman figure accordingly.
Restart and Quit Options: Included options for players to restart the game or exit, enhancing the overall user experience.
Responsibilities:

Python Programming: Developed the game logic and functionality using Python.
Tkinter Integration: Created and managed the GUI components using the Tkinter library.
OOP Design: Structured the application using OOP principles to ensure modularity, code reusability, and ease of maintenance.
Testing and Debugging: Conducted extensive testing to identify and resolve bugs, ensuring a smooth and engaging gameplay experience.
Documentation: Documented the codebase and provided clear instructions for future enhancements and maintenance.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in Python programming, GUI development with Tkinter, and the application of OOP concepts, highlighting my ability to create engaging and user-friendly software solutions.
